## String.prototype.padEnd

This a polyfill for the [padEnd](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padEnd) function from the ECMAScript 8

## Why Another One?

Because of the already writtern polyfills are too complicated and I wanted something simpler and doesn't relys on other new prototypes!.
